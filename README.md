# Appletini.js
A totally useless JavaScript library with a stupid name that makes it's creator chuckle

## What it actually does
It provides a function to return an Appletini recipe. It's probably not the best Appletini recipe, I've never tried it, I just copied it off of the sidebar in a google search. I'm not sure if I've ever actually had an Appletini to be honest. Feel free to fork it with your own recipe.

## Limitation of Liability
This library is licensed under GPL-3.0 because I don't want to be held liable if the Appletini tastes bad or if you get too drunk and write a bunch of bad code.
